national_indicator_available: Women in management positions in business and in the federal civil service    

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator 5.1.b shows the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies. Indicator 5.1.c shows the percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service.    

dns_indicator_intention: Women are as highly qualified as men, yet they are under-represented in management positions in German business, particularly at senior management level. The same applies to the percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service. For this reason, the share of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies is to be increased to 30&nbsp;% by 2030. Under the bill for a Second Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act, which became effective on 21&nbsp;August 2021, equal representation of women and men in management positions in the civil service is to be achieved by 2025.    

data_state: The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/">indicator report 2022</a>.    

indicator_name: Women in management positions in business and in the federal civil service
